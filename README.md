DriveX – Car Website

this website is about selling luxury and sports cars.
i made it to look like a real car dealership website where users can explore cars and see their details.

when you open the website you see the header at the top.
it has the DriveX logo and a navigation bar.
the navigation bar has buttons like cars, about and contact.
when you click them it moves you to that section.

under the header there is the hero section.
it has a big car image, a title and a button called explore cars.
when you click explore cars it takes you to the cars section.
#car section
then there is the cars section.
this section shows different cars.
each car has:imageof the car ,name, price,horsepower, engine info
add to cart button
 note that : the add to cart button does not actually work.
it is only for design and visual purposes.
it does not really add the car to a real cart.
#about section
after that there is the about section.
this section explains the history of DriveX and why customers trust it.
it makes the website look more professional and real.
#branch section
then there is the branches section.
it shows company branches like dubai and other locations.
each branch has its location, phone number and a view map button.
the map shows the branch location.
#contact
the last section is the contact section.
it has contact information and a simple form.
users can write their email and message and press send.
